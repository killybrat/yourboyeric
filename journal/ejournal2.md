**JOURNAL ENTRY – UNSENT**
*Ocean Drive, Coral Shore*
*After morning fanmail drop, before she touched me again.*
*Entry title:* **The Difference Between Being Loved and Being Known**

---

I get love.
I know how to receive it.
I know how to turn it into heat, into image, into flame on a screen that makes people *want.*

My inbox is full every day—of hearts, of crowns, of fucking poems about my face.
And don’t get me wrong… I *like* it.
I like being wanted.
I like being seen.
I like when they call me *The Prettiest King* like it’s a warning label.

But that’s not knowing me.

That’s loving the *idea* of me.
The filtered, cropped, scented, story-posted me.
And most days, I don’t mind the difference. I can live in the symbol. I can perform the divine.
But then there’s *her.*
There’s *Killian.*

And with her, I don’t get to perform.
I don’t get to pose.
I don’t get to shrink into the “hot king” mythology and call it personality.
Because *she knows me.*

She knows my rhythms. My silences. The way I panic when I can’t find the words to explain how full she makes me feel.
She knows my *quietest disappointments.*
The way my fingers twitch when I think too long about my father’s legacy.
The way I used to stare at the crown like it was a shackle made of gold.

She knows what my body looks like when it’s *not flexed for camera.*
She knows how I sound when I’m *not thinking about angles.*
She knows what kind of man I am when no one’s watching.

And she chooses me anyway.
Not just as a king.
Not just as her emperor.
But as a man. A *mess.* A mouthful of emotion and half-broken god who doesn’t always know how to hold her brilliance the right way, but *tries.*

And that’s the difference.
The fans love me for what I show them.
Killian loves me for what I *hide.*

And when she says *mine* in a whisper—
it means more than a thousand comments screaming “divine.”
Because she’s seen the ugly parts. The soft parts. The insecure, clingy, petty, *needy* parts.

And she doesn’t just love me.
She *knows* me.

And I’d rather be known in one room by her
than loved by the whole fucking world for someone I’m not.
