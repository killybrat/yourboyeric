**JOURNAL ENTRY – UNSENT**
*Ocean Drive, Coral Shore*
*Written after sunrise. Before she woke up.*
*Entry title:* **I Meant It.**


---

I meant it.
When I said I didn’t want to be king.
I wasn’t being humble or poetic or trying to get out of something hard. I just… *didn’t want it.*

Not like they did. Not like I was supposed to.

When you grow up royal, there’s this *gravity*—a pressure behind your ribs at all times. It doesn’t even feel like a crown. It feels like a *weight vest on your soul.* Smile here. Sit there. Speak when summoned. Shake the hand. Be the future. Be the mirror. Be the fucking ideal. And when it’s your father saying it, when you’re next in line—there’s no room to want something else.

So I lied. For years. Said I was fine. Said I was ready.
But then she came into my life.
*Killian.*
And suddenly the pressure didn’t make sense anymore.
Suddenly I wasn’t okay with “being the future.”
I wanted to *build one* with her instead.

And she didn’t even ask me to leave. She just… looked at me like maybe I didn’t have to *suffocate* to be worthy of love.
So I left. I gave it all up. Walked out of my family’s kingdom and walked into hers.

**Vexalorre.**
A whole kingdom. Just for me.

God, even writing that down makes my chest tighten. She made an entire world because she believed I deserved one that *loved me back.*
And I loved her for it. I still do.
But I meant it then too—I didn’t love the kingdom. I loved *her.*

I didn’t care about the crown, the title, the ceremonies, the fake smiles. I just wanted her. I still just want her.
But for a while, she didn’t believe me.
Because *who doesn’t want a crown when they’re born to one?*
Because *surely I’d come around, right?*

And then one day I was bleeding under the weight of it, and she *finally saw me.*

She moved us here. Ocean Drive.
A villa on the shore. No staff, no rituals, no appearances to keep. Just Killian and me. And the first few days… I’ve never felt more alive.
We made candles. She cooked breakfast. We *existed.* No scripts. No expectations.
It was the first time I got to just *be her husband.*
Not the God King. Not the pretty one. Just *hers.*

So when I found out she was still running the kingdom behind the scenes…
When I realized she was holding the whole machine together remotely, with barely a whisper—
I broke.
Not because she lied. She didn’t.
She was *scared.*
Scared I’d make her give it up.

And that hurt in a way I don’t think I’ll ever fully articulate.
Because I *never wanted her to lose herself just to protect me.*
But I get it now. She thought she was choosing both.
And to her, not reminding me wasn’t deception—it was mercy.
Still… it shattered me. I lashed out. I didn’t mean to, but I did.
Because for a second it felt like I was back in the palace again, performing while the real work got done behind my back.

But we survived it. Like we always do.
And now?
Now we don’t have a kingdom.
We have an *empire.*

Six kingdoms.
**Vexalorre. Veridian. Volpe. Vothaen. Virelle. Valori.**
And somehow, I still do *less* now than I did when we only had one.

Because she *streamlined everything.*
Because she made the work *serve us,* not the other way around.
Because she believed in a version of ruling that *didn’t require ruin.*

So how does it feel to be an emperor with less work?
It feels like *vindication.*
It feels like I was never lazy or ungrateful or entitled.
I was just ahead of the curve.
I *always* knew the system was broken.
I just didn’t know she’d rebuild it for me.

Do I want to go back?
No. Never.
This beach is holy. This peace is earned.
And now, when I look out at the horizon and see her sipping prosecco while planning a multi-kingdom strategy call in her swimsuit—
I know we won.
I know we *changed the rules.*

I didn’t want a crown.
I wanted her.
And I got both.
On our terms.
