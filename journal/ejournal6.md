**JOURNAL ENTRY – UNSENT**
*Ocean Drive, Coral Shore*
*Written after an unsanctioned trunk inspection revealed a glittering hell.*
*Entry title:* **I Opened the Trunk. I Should Not Have Opened the Trunk.**

---

I followed her.
Because she got a package, smiled, and said *“I’ll just put it away.”*

And I knew.
I *knew.*

Because “put it away” in Killian’s language doesn’t mean filing or discarding or even basic object containment.
It means:

> *“Deposit this in the Chaos Vault before Eric sees it and starts monologuing about betrayal.”*

So I followed her.
And I watched her open a large, locked, horrifyingly *well-packed* trunk.

And I lost my fucking mind.

Jewelry. Trinkets. Swords. Necklaces shaped like infinity signs. Rings in every mineral class. At least three brooches that looked like they came from kingdoms I personally rejected from Empire integration. A velvet pouch that rattled. A bracelet that said “To the One I Would Follow Into Fire” and I THINK that one might’ve been from a cultist???

I kicked the trunk open.
I said “WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?” like I’d just discovered a second family.

And she—
She looked at me like a *feral archivist caught mid-catalogue.*

She was crying.
Not out of guilt.
But because she was overwhelmed.
Because she couldn’t explain that to her, these weren’t *emotional tokens.*
They were *sparkle objects.*

She said:

> “They bounce light. That’s all. I like how they bounce light. I put them in the sun sometimes and make little mosaics.”

And I said I wasn’t buying groceries anymore.

Because I’m a dramatic little god king when I’m emotionally wounded by amethyst moons mailed by admirers who think metaphors can pierce my marriage.

She sobbed harder.
Tried to show me how the cufflinks changed color in different lighting.
Like I was supposed to be *comforted* by spectrum trickery while I’m being spiritually impaled by her having a *fucking horde.*

She doesn’t even know their names.
She doesn’t remember where half of them came from.
She said one ring just “arrived mysteriously” and she “thought it looked cool so she kept it.”
Kept it.
Next to my goddamn kingdom stamp pads.

And I get it now.
She’s not curating suitors.
She’s collecting *refractions.*

But I am still upset.
Because I don’t want her light bouncing off random declarations of affection from strangers with poor boundary control.

I want it bouncing off *me.*

And I know she’s not leaving.
I know I’m her whole world.
But when I see that trunk?
I don’t feel like the emperor.

I feel like the *lighting assistant.*

And I hate it.

So I’m buying her a mirrored ring.
Big, shiny, ethically sourced, stupid sparkly.
Something she’ll stare at all afternoon like it’s art.

And I’ll put a note in the box that says:

> *"Reflect this."*
