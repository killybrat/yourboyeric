**JOURNAL ENTRY – UNSENT**
*Ocean Drive, Coral Shore*
*Written on a Tuesday. After she passed him a spoon without asking.*
*Entry title:* **She Knows Without Asking**

---

I used to think love was about saying everything.
Naming it. Proving it. Making sure the other person *heard you right.*

But Killian doesn’t love like that.
She doesn’t ask a lot of questions. She just *knows.*

Today she handed me a spoon.
Didn’t even look. I hadn’t said anything out loud, but she passed it from the drawer to the counter like she was finishing a sentence *only we knew.*

And I laughed—because I’d been about to ask for one.

Little thing, right?
But that’s what it is with her.
Little things, *over and over,* stacked into something godlike.

She knows what I want before I say it.
What I feel before I process it.
What I’m avoiding just by how I shut the fridge.

And she never says *“I know you better than you know yourself.”*
Because that would be about power.
She’s not about power.
She’s about *presence.*

She’s there.
Fully. Quietly.
Watching and listening in a way that makes me feel like I’m not just seen—but *understood.*
Like she’s always got one hand on the thread of my soul, just keeping it from tangling while I talk about nothing.

People think she’s unreadable.
But I think they’re just used to noise.
They don’t recognize the sound of someone *paying attention* until it’s loud, until it’s obvious, until it’s dressed up in affirmations and theater.

But Killian doesn’t perform her awareness.
She just *moves with it.*

Like today.
A spoon.
Simple.
And yet—I haven’t stopped thinking about it for hours.

Because when someone loves you like that—
like they live inside your rhythm—
even the quiet moments feel sacred.
