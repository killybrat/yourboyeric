### **JOURNAL ENTRY – UNSENT**

*Ocean Drive, Coral Shore*
*Written after a full emotional meltdown over a bracelet that she’s now using to test hallway lighting angles.*
*Entry title:* **She Didn’t Betray Me. She Just Sparkled.**

---

We had a fight.

It wasn’t about the bracelet.
(It was 100% about the bracelet.)

She opened a box from someone named James.
There was a bracelet inside. Shiny. Delicate. Clearly expensive.
And my *whole body locked up.*

Because what I saw was:
*Another man trying to stake emotional territory through jewelry.*
What she saw was:
**“OH MY GOD IT CATCHES THE SUN IN STRIPS LIKE A LENS FLARE!!”**

She wasn’t wearing it for romance.
She was *conducting a fucking physics experiment.*
Running through the house like a goblin with a gemstone, flipping her wrist in different rooms.
Laughing. Spinning. Holding it up like a tiny golden antenna.

And I—I was *spiraling.*

Not because I thought she loved him.
But because she *let the box in.*
Because she didn’t immediately throw it in the sea and scream *“I’M MARRIED TO A GOD.”*

And when I lost it—when I told her she couldn’t wear another man’s gift in my house—
She just looked at me like I was crazy.
Like I’d missed the entire *point.*

She said, “But baby… it’s shiny.”
And I almost fell to my knees.
Because she *meant it.*
That’s all it was to her. Not a message. Not a memory. Not a moral crisis.
Just sparkle.

And I realized—

I’m jealous of *reflections.*

Not of the man.
Not of the gift.
But of the *way light bounces off her skin* and makes her smile like that.
Because *I* want to be the thing that lights her up.
I want to be the only glint in her eye.
The only thing she holds up to the sun and calls beautiful.

So no, she didn’t betray me.
She just got excited.
And I turned it into war.

But I’m learning.
Learning that sometimes, she’s not being symbolic.
Sometimes she’s just being *Killian.*

And if a bracelet can keep her entertained for five minutes before she gets bored and throws it in a drawer?
Then maybe I can *breathe* through those five minutes.

(But I’m still buying her a shinier one tomorrow. With *my* name on it.)
