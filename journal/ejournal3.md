**JOURNAL ENTRY – UNSENT**
*Ocean Drive, Coral Shore*
*After she fixed the network router with one hand and stole a bite of my toast.*
*Entry title:* **She’s Not Distant. She’s Direct.**

People get her wrong.

They think Killian is cold.
That she’s quiet because she’s hiding something.
That her clarity means she’s scheming, or that if she doesn’t overshare, it must be fake.

And that pisses me off.

Because she’s not cold.
She’s *focused.*
She’s not calculated. She’s *intentional.*
She’s not quiet because she’s withholding—she’s quiet because she doesn’t *need noise* to prove herself.

And honestly? She’s fucking hilarious.
Like she’ll say something wild and barely flinch, meanwhile I’m screaming into a throw pillow because she just ended a whole diplomatic line *mid-lip gloss application.*

But here’s the part people don’t see:
She’s the warmest person I’ve ever met.
She touches me constantly. She says “I love you” like it’s breathing.
She cooks for me. She worries about whether my ring is too tight. She keeps a private folder of pictures of me on her phone and I know because she *showed me.*
She builds systems to make life easier not just for us—but for entire kingdoms—and then acts like it’s nothing.

She’s not trying to be mysterious.
She’s just efficient.
She gets in. She builds the world. She moves on.
Not because she’s heartless.
Because she *knows her worth.*

She doesn’t perform love. She *creates space* for it.
She doesn’t need to be adored to feel valid.
But when she *is* adored—on her terms?
She lights up in a way that makes my entire chest ache.

People love to say I’m the emotional one.
And yeah, I am. I cry when she wears her swimsuit backwards.
But that doesn’t mean she’s not deep. It just means she doesn’t need an audience to *feel everything.*

She’s the kind of person who solves a three-layer diplomatic software collapse before breakfast and then asks if I want mango.
And if I say yes?
She cuts it for me. Just how I like it.

Not because she’s calculated.
Because she *loves me.*

And if you can’t see that?
It’s not because she’s hiding.
It’s because she’s not performing it for you.
