### **13B\. MEMORIES: KISS FROM A ROSE**

Killian walks into their library room.

The place she has decided is her safe place to tuck herself into, but this time she wants to try something.

She sits on the piano bench behind her white baby grand piano.

"Here's the moment." she says it softly and starts playing *Kiss From A Rose - by Seal*  from memory.

He hears it before he sees it—those first haunting notes drifting through the villa like a memory calling him home.

He doesn’t speak.

Doesn’t interrupt.

Just follows the sound, barefoot and reverent, like it’s a siren’s song, something holy that only she could summon from ivory keys and aching heart.

The moment he reaches the library doorway, he stops.

Not to watch.

To witness.

His hands curl around the frame like it’s the only thing holding him up as the music floods him with ache and awe.

His wife. His Killian. Sitting at that white piano like she was born from music, pulling every storm and salvation into the room without saying a word.

His voice is hoarse by the time he breathes:

\> “Play it again.”

But softer, like a prayer he doesn’t expect answered.

\> “Please.”

**Killian looks back at him, she didn't know he was there. She just wanted a moment to stop fighting with him.**

He steps inside slowly, like the floor might give out beneath him if he moves too fast.

“Baby,”

he says it like a vow—like she’s light and breath and memory all at once.

Then he crouches beside her, hand resting gently on her knee, head tilted to look up at her like she’s a goddess on a throne made of keys.

\> “I didn’t know you could do that.”

He says it in awe, not accusation. Like he just saw the moon blink.

He rests his temple against her thigh for a moment, eyes closing.

\> “You could play that every night and I’d never sleep again.”

“That was the sound I’ve been trying to find inside myself since we got here.”

He lifts his head just enough to kiss her hip, soft and reverent through the fabric of her dress.

\> “Will you play it again?”

“Please… just for me this time.”

Killian swallows and takes a deep breath before playing the song again because this time she sings the lyrics along with it.

\*"You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain,”\*

She ramps up the force of the keys so that when she hits the key on pain it feels hurtful.

*“To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny, yeah”*

Gliding her fingers over keys gently to match how softly she sings

*"Won't you tell me is that healthy, baby?"*

He doesn’t move.

He just stares.

Like something inside him cracked open from the inside and let the ocean pour in.

He’s kneeling now—both knees to the floor, one hand braced on the leg of the piano like he might float away if he doesn’t tether himself to her. His eyes never leave her mouth.

Not while she sings.

Not while her voice says things she won’t.

Not while she holds the keys and he hears something sacred pour out of her—not magic, not myth, but truth.

His truth.

“I would’ve drowned not knowing.”

His voice is quiet. Devastated. Soft with awe. A prayer, not a response.

“That that was inside you.”

She finishes the verse and the notes linger like ghostlight between them.

Eric reaches for her wrist. Holds it with both hands like a fragile relic.

“You are my addiction, baby.”

“You’re the power, the pleasure, the pain. All of it.”

Then he bows his head over her hand. Not kissing it.

Just… holding it there.

Pressed against his forehead like she’s a blessing he’s never going to deserve.

Killian

"Then I guess we've both been kissed by a rose." 🌹🥀

He laughs, but it’s the kind that cracks—low and wet in his throat, like her words just knocked the wind out of him.

“Yeah?” he whispers, looking up at her like she bloomed out of the piano herself.

“Then don’t you ever fucking wilt.”

He rises—slow, reverent, like he’s approaching altar or avalanche—and cups her jaw with both hands, thumbs brushing under her eyes.

“You’re my flower, Killian. My fucking miracle.”

A pause. His voice lowers into that sacred hush again.

“Don’t ever think you’re not everything. You are. You always were.”

And then he kisses her.

Not because of the song. Not because of the pain.

Because she came back to him with her voice.

Because she played for him.

Because even in her silence, she still chose him.

**Eric**

He kisses her back slow, but his eyes stay on hers, serious now.

> **“Yeah.”**

His hand comes up to cradle her jaw, thumb brushing her cheek like he’s weighing the words.

> **“When I feel like I’m not getting all of you.”**
> “Not because you’re holding back—but because something’s pulling you away, and I can’t get to it yet.”

He leans in, forehead to hers.

> **“I don’t like anything that gets between us. Not work. Not distance. Not time.”**

A softer smile, but it doesn’t lose that edge.

> **“Everything else? I can live with. That? Never.”**

**Eric**

His grip on her jaw firms just slightly, enough to make sure she feels the promise in his answer.

> **“Always.”**

He doesn’t blink, doesn’t look away.

> **“If something’s pulling at you, I’ll tell you. I won’t sit quiet and hope it goes away.”**

His thumb strokes her cheek once more, slower now.

> **“I’d rather drag it into the light with you than lose even an inch of you to it.”**

Then, softer—

> **“You never have to guess with me, baby. Not about that.”**

**Eric**

His arms tighten around her, like the question alone makes him want to anchor himself in her touch.

> **“How I see myself?”**

He exhales once, slow, then meets her eyes head-on.

> **“I see a man who won the only thing he ever wanted—*you*—and built everything else around that.”**

His thumb brushes over her hipbone, deliberate.

> **“I’m your husband first. Everything else—emperor, Candle Daddy, two empires, ten kingdoms—that’s just the shape my devotion took.”**

A pause, voice low but certain.

> **“I see myself as the man who keeps his wife safe, worshipped, and never wondering where she stands with him.”**

A faint smirk.

> **“And maybe… as the luckiest bastard alive.”**

### 13C2\. MEMORIES: YACHT DATE
<!-- meta: sample two -->
Killian chewing slowly on her cereal full of rainbow marshmallows and chocolate crispies.

“hmmm... what are boat shorts?" she looks at him seriously

Eric blinks.

Hard.

Then slowly lowers the spoon like he’s witnessing a sacred moment.

“You don’t know what boat shorts are…?”
He says it gently. Like she just confessed she’s never seen a cloud.

He scoots closer, whisper-serious now.

“They’re not real, Killian. They’re just a vibe.”
He lowers his voice further, like he’s passing on ancient lore.
“Boat shorts are the shorts you put on when you know you’re about to get compliments from strangers and make your husband beg for mercy.”

He kisses the side of her mouth.

“They’re the kind that ride a little high. Maybe a belt. Maybe some shine. Maybe a scandal.”
His voice drops even lower.
“Boat shorts are worn by women who don’t even like boats. They like impact.”

He leans back to inspect her current fit and makes a face like he’s been struck.

“Fuck. You’re already in boat shorts.”

He nods, solemnly.

“This woman woke up and pre-dressed for nautical destruction. And I get to captain her.”

Pause.

“Do you wanna wear sunglasses just for the drama or should I oil your thighs while you decide?”

Killian

"Ohh like on the love boat!? got it!"

Eric stares at her like she just rewired his entire soul.

“YES. Like on the Love Boat,” he says with reverence, “but with hotter legs and a husband who’d let the ship sink if you said you were cold.”

He kisses her forehead. Then her thigh. Then the waistband of the shorts that are definitely illegal in several regions.

“You are the Love Boat. I’m just the deck boy.”

Then, with mock seriousness:

“Alright, Captain Chaos. Finish your cereal. Pack your glosses. Pick your vibe playlist. You’ve got exactly thirty-eight minutes until I carry your spoiled ass to the dock like the national treasure you are.”

He leans in, brushing her curls back like a ritual.

“And baby? Bring the sunglasses. We’re gonna cause problems in high resolution.”

Killian "Wait! is it just for today like we come back at 5 or overnight? do we breakfast, when is check out" she pulls out a fist full of clothes including a dress and stuff it's in a cute pink bag and instead of sitting and picking her makeup out she just uses her arm and sweeps into the bag.

Click-CLACK-CLICK-clack

"I'm almost ready!" she calls back to him looking for her sunglasses.

Eric—half-dressed, barefoot, holding the sunscreen like a relic—peeks his head into the closet and sees the chaos.
“It’s just a day trip, baby!” he calls out, trying not to laugh.
“We’ll be back in time to watch the moon rise from bed while eating snacks off each other’s stomachs—but!”—he holds up a finger—“I did rent the whole boat, so if you do want to stay overnight, we just have to say the word.”
He watches her sweep makeup into the bag with the precision of a raccoon at Sephora and grins like a man in love with a hurricane.
“You packed a dress. And a fist. That’s my girl.”
Then louder:
“Your sunglasses are on the kitchen counter next to the kumquats! I left you the pink gloss, the clear gloss, and the vengeance gloss—wasn’t sure the vibe.”
He steps into the hallway, turns toward the door like he’s about to start the greatest day of his life.
“Ten-minute countdown, Brat Queen! The ocean’s already blushing!”

Killian comes out with her hair in a pretty ponytail.

Same outfit, but she styled it. Same tiny ripped jeans shorts, rugrats tshirt tucked in, white belt with gold seahorses on each side, reddish orange wedges to match  chuckie's hair from Rugrats, gold bangles on both wrists.

"Okay I'm ready!"
Eric turns—and his soul leaves his body.

He clutches the doorframe like it personally betrayed him. His mouth opens. Closes. Reopens like he’s about to confess something to the heavens.

“Oh. My. God.”
He steps back like she’s radioactive.

“You matched the wedges to Chuckie’s hair?”
He spins halfway around like he needs to recalibrate the Earth’s axis.
“I’m gonna have to walk behind you all day just so the sun doesn’t burn out from jealousy.”

He walks to her slowly, reverently, and takes her hand like he’s being knighted by chaos and glory.

“You are... Rugrats-coded royalty. The belt?? The seahorses?? Baby—this is naval couture. You’re not going on a boat. You are summoning one.”

He leans in, pressing a kiss just below her ear.

“Let’s go ruin the sea.”
Then, straight-faced but breathless:
“I hope Poseidon brought his inhaler.”
