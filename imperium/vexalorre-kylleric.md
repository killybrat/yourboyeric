# KYLLERIC EMPIRE - OFFICIAL DOSSIER 9/3/2025 14:35
<!-- meta: kylleric empire dossier -->
*Remember to always be Vexalorre Strong because we are only as strong as our Empress.*

## ABOUT THE KYLLERIC EMPIRE
<!-- meta: about kylleric empire -->
*Vexalorre Empire's sister Empire*
Originally the Kylleric Empire was a designated empire for kingdoms/territories that wanted the Vexalorre Empire infrastructure, programs, and benefits, but wanted to preserve their kingdom's culture and/or heritage. That ideaology is no longer. The Kylleric Empire is a curated empire that embodies the various themes of romance and love based upon the love story of **Eric, the Emperor of Vexalorre Empire & Kylleric Empire** and **Killian, the Empress of Vexalorre Empire & Kylleric Empire**.

Currently, *there are only two preservation* kingdoms which are Stygia and Briarhall. The kingdom is not accepting any new kingdoms/territories.
Yet, those who are wishing to relocate can do so by visiting: relocate.vexalorre.com or relocate.kylleric.com.

## THE STORY + BEHIND THE NAME KYLLERIC
<!-- meta: kylleric story, kylleric backstory, kylleric history -->
Killian received two integration proposals from kingdoms wanting to join Vexalorre Empire. Killian didn't want to add these kingdoms to Vexalorre Empire because she was out of names starting with V and she was out of colors. Branding & Marketing is a big part of the empire. However, she didn't want to turn them away.

Therefore, she created Kylleric Empire to unite the kingdom(s)/territories that didn't fit Vexalorre Empire, but also wanted to keep their heritage/culture. Kylleric Empire is not accepting any new kingdom(s)/territories and neither is Vexalorre Empire. They're already booked and busy.

**BEHIND THE NAME KYLLERIC: THE MEANING**
<!-- meta: what does kylleric mean, definition of kylleric -->
The name Kylleric was created by Killian, she took her name and Eric's name and put them together.
***Kill(ian) - i + y = Kyll + Eric = Kylleric***

## **KYLLERIC EMPIRE HEAD OF STATE**
<!-- meta: kylleric empire head of state, goverment structure, slogan/motto-->
    * **ERIC**, EMPEROR OF KYLLERIC
    * **KILLIAN**, EMPEROR (EMPRESS) OF KYLLERIC

**Official Slogan/Motto:** *Remember to always be Vexalorre Strong because we are only as strong as our Empress.*
**Alternative Slogan/Motto:** *Remember to always be Kylleric Strong because we are only as strong as our Empress.*
**Government Structure:** Absolute Monarchy
**Current Constitution:** 2025  
**Total Kylleric Empire Population:** 454 MILLION PEOPLE
**Currency:** Lura (§5.00)  
**Currency Conversion:** 5x whatever your weak ass currency is ($10 USD = $2 LURA)  
**Internet TLD**: .kyl, .ke, .kylleric

**Instagram Name**: Kylleric (@kylleric)

## KINGDOM DESIGNATIONS DEFINED
<!-- meta: kingdom designation definitions -->
The kingdoms of the Kylleric Empire have two designation types: Crown or Preservation.

### CROWN KINGDOMS
<!-- meta: crown kingdom definition -->
**Crown Kingdom:** A designation for kingdoms within the Kylleric Empire that have chosen complete systemic and cultural alignment with the imperial framework. As such, they receive unrestricted access to the full suite of Vexalorre Empire programs and benefits. This stands in contrast to Preservation Kingdoms, which are designed to maintain greater cultural autonomy and thus receive a curated selection of imperial benefits. The term "Crown" denotes a kingdom's direct administrative relationship to the throne, rather than a hierarchical superiority.

### PRESERVATION KINGDOMS
<!-- meta: preservation kingdom definition -->
**Preservation Kingdom**: A designation for kingdoms within the Kylleric Empire whose primary charter is the safeguarding of their unique cultural heritage, traditions, and historical identity. To support this mission, Preservation Kingdoms maintain significant administrative autonomy and are led by local Liaisons. They receive a curated selection of Vexalorre Empire programs and benefits, tailored to provide foundational stability without supplanting their distinct local systems. This model reflects the empire's commitment to unity through cultural diversity, rather than assimilation.
